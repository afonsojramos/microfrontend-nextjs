# Microfrontends with Next.js and Module Federation

First came across [Microfrontends](https://micro-frontends.org/) on a Luca Mezzalira talk about the topic. It sounded very interesting on paper for big companies and I wanted to try it out.

For this we need to use [Module Federation NextJS plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@module-federation/nextjs-mf). It seems that it is now under a [paywall](https://app.privjs.com/buy/packageDetail?pkg=@module-federation/nextjs-mf), however, some versions of it are still available in npm. At the time of writing it seems to be above `v3`, however, to experiment with this I've used `v1`, which was the version I've found more documentation about.

Overall it seems like a cool technology, but I wouldn't use it in any of my projects at the moment. Maybe if it comes out of the paywall I might give it another go.

You can find the deployment for this POC [here](https://microfrontend-nextjs-poc.vercel.app/).
